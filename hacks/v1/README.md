# Version 1

This version is using the rootfs binary image with the busybox and dropbear compilation of https://github.com/ant-thomas/zsgx1hacks. Furthermore it uses the passwd as well as the code to start an httpd.
So if you're flashing this image, you can use ```root // cxlinux ``` to get access via uart serial.

 Just copy this image to a sdcard and let the camera boot. It will extract itself.
